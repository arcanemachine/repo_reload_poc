# RepoReloadPoc

A proof-of-concept for using `Repo.reload/2` with Ecto schemas with multiple primary keys. 

## Getting started

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/arcanemachine/repo_reload_poc`

- Set up a fresh Postgres database: `mix ecto.reset`

- Run the tests: `mix test`

The main code is in `lib/repo_reload_poc.ex`. Let me know what you think!

Or, [open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/arcanemachine/repo_reload_poc/issues/new) and give me your feedback that way.

Thanks for taking a look!
